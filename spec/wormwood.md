Wormwood is a trivial, SQL-ish, flat-file, schemaless, read-only database. It attempts to be the simplest possible implementation of standard database architectural ideas. 

Wormwood provides a REPL that can process [SELECT queries](./select). 

Data source columns can [be indexed](./indexing) for slightly faster searching.
